I'm a developer trying to learn and grow. As a way to push myself I'm activally learning more mobile developement as a web development through learning Javascript, React, Next.JS, Node, and Bun to fully understand the full stack development. I am also taking a stab at GoLang in order to write efficent and fast multithreaded API's. 

I'm still learning, and always trying to push myself. I love to build things and feel most productive when I'm building something I feel will benefit the community at large.

I'm interested in collaboration on projects, just ping me and I can see what I can help with.
