```Swift
    let user = MobileDev(
        name: "Jesse C Anderson",
        title: "Mobile Dev",
        lanuages: ["Swift", "Dart"],
        frameworks: ["UIKit", "SwiftUI", "Vapor", "Flutter"]
        tools: ["Xcode", "Docker", "AWS"]
    )
```

I'm an iOS developer trying to learn and grow. I'm currently working on learning more around SwiftUI while also building skills around Flutter/Dart.

I'm still learning, and always trying to push myself. I love to build things and feel most productive when I'm building something I feel will benefit the community at large.

I'm interested in collaboration on mobile projects, just ping me and I can see what I can help with.
